\section{Key aspects involved in SA-specialization}
\paragraph{We chose} to represent the board as a simple matrix, that is a list holding lists. We implemented in Python, so the implementation should be pretty straight forward.

\paragraph{The objective function} evaluates how good a solution may be. In our implementation it counts the number of eggs that breaks a constraint on each row and column.

\paragraph{Neighbour generation} is a very important part of this problem, as the tuning of the current state to these neighbours is what the whole solution is based upon. In our implementation we generate \begin{math}N\cdot M\end{math} neighbours. For each neighbour we take one cell from the state and replace false/true. Everything else is the same. We'll get between 5 and 15 \% in each neighbour. Some neighbours may be equal, so a possible improvement would be to implement it with a set instead of a list.
